### üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions for Linux/UNIX

Clone the repository to your directory

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SFENX-Group/XPwm.git
```

Enter the directory of the source code

```sh
cd XPwm/
```

Build the makefile with CMake, if you don't have cmake you have to install it.

```sh
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B "build"
```

Than our Makefile is ready for build the source code. We have to access the directory of makefile and run make.

```sh
cd build && make -j$(nproc)
```

Than our compiled binary is ready for run in the directory of the makefile with the name "xpwm"
You can run the sample program with this command

```sh
./xpwm
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Install Instructions for Linux/UNIX

There is an install script named `install.sh` that can be used for Arch-based and newer Debian-based systems. If your system does not meet these requirements, you can try the AppImage file available in the releases section.

Clone the repository to your directory

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SFENX-Group/XPwm.git
